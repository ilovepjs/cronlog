# cronlog

Prompts you to write daily logs and stores logs in a Github repository

Need to setup a github SSH key for it to work. 

Setup as follow:

`git clone https://github.com/ilovepjs/cronlog.git`
  
`// CD to the directory you would like the logs to be created in`
  
`python path_to_cronlog/setup.py`
